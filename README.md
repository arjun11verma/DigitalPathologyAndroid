# Digital Pathology Mobile App

The Digital Pathology Mobile App is an application that allows users to take slide images of a cancer slide directly from a microscope and sent them to our server for stitching/uploading. It is the first part of our image pipeline, which moves from app to server to database. 

## Installation/Usage

In order to run this app in Android Studio, then openCVLibrary341 must be installed. As well as this, the MongoDB and Volley libraries must also be installed.
